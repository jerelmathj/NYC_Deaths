Leading causes of death in NYC (2007-2020)
I am interested in this data set because I've lived here all my life and seeing data about New Yorkers' mortality interests me. We have terrible pollution, habits, ill people, J-walkers + more recently scooter/biker incidents in NYC. It's a broad array of lifestyles, ethincities, ages, and everything so this study really piqued my interest.
I found the data set from NYC Open Data, link -> https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam
The dataset was produced by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
The dataset collected information from 2007 and has results as recently as December 2020.
The dataset documents majority of deaths since 2007, specifically what illness caused the expiration of said human or what caused the death of the person. The dataset also categorizes these deaths to the type of individual who passed away such as age, race, sex, and the rate at which deaths occur due to their relative causes.
